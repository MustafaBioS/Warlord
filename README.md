**About:**

The Warlord is an RPG Slack game bot where you can go on sieges, raids, assassinations, or even defend your castle for XP and to rank up.
You have Heidi and Orpheus who always try their best to help you, The more missions you do the more The Warlord becomes proud of you and ranks you up,
You also get random items or maybe even sword upgrades whenever you do a mission, but missions have different cooldowns depending on the rewards and how big it is.
If you're a high rank there's a chance to get ambushed after a battle.
